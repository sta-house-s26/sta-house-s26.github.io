## Textbooks

You are not required to purchase a textbook for this class. 

In the **PREPARE** column of the [course schedule](https://sta-house-s26.github.io/), we will note which papers are reading for next class.

## Technology

Tech will be used in most classes. In general, you will need access to a device with internet so that you can use the following:

-   [This course page](https://sta240-f25.github.io/) that you are on right now;
-   `R`/`RStudio` via the [Duke Container Manager](https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers);
-   [Canvas](https://go.canvas.duke.edu/), through which you can access...
    -   [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/1071176);
    -   [Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/courses/80868/discussion);
-   [Zoom](https://duke.zoom.us/) (e.g. for remote office hours).

If access to technology becomes a concern for you during the semester, contact the instructor immediately to discuss options.
