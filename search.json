Have a ball. The internet is saturated with good (and horrible) resources for learning this material, so if you find something that really resonates with you, have at it;\n*Doing the work for you**: If you ask a language model to generate a summary, and you copy it down and submit it as your own work, that is plagiarism. If we detect it, you will earn a zero for that part of your write-up.\n\n“Using ChatGPT to complete assignments is like bringing a forklift into the weight room; you will never improve your cognitive fitness that way.” Furthermore, this course is a half-credit, pass-fail course purely for your own interest. As such, outsourcing all of your thinking to an AI will probably end in this entire enterprise being a complete waste of time and energy. To avoid this, I suggest you abstain from using language models to do the reading/thinking for you.",
