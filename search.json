    "text": "This is a course on the mathematics of probability and statistics. In probability, we describe the distribution of a random phenomenon and then study how the realizations of that phenomenon typically behave. In statistics, we do the reverse; we observe realizations of a random phenomenon with unknown distribution, and then use the data to figure out what the distribution is. We will spend twelve weeks on the first, and then three weeks on the second. Topics include set theory, probability spaces, counting methods, conditional probability, discrete and (absolutely) continuous random variables, transformations of random variables, (pseudo)random number generation, bivariate distributions, concentration inequalities, limit theorems, maximum likelihood estimation, and Bayesian inference with conjugate priors.\nAside from the concrete topics, the course emphasizes four generic intellectual themes:\n\nStudents in this class will improve their mathematical maturity. They will deepen their experience with all of the main ideas and techniques of univariate calculus, they will encounter topics like set theory and combinatorics, which may be new to them, and they will get a taste of rigorous mathematical proof;\nProbability and statistics weasel their way into pretty much everything these days, and students will study a wide variety of famous and obscure applications coming from the natural and social sciences, technology and industry, and even arts and culture;\nProbability and statistics are often counterintuitive, and humans frequently make silly and harmful mistakes in reasoning. Students will use their mathematical knowledge to identify and critique these errors…and hopefully avoid them themselves;\nThis is a course about doing the math, but in the modern era, this has a symbiotic relationship with computer simulation. Simulation is used both to verify and probe mathematical results, as well as to substitute for them when a proof remains beyond the frontier.

Members of this community commit to reflect upon and uphold these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.\nDuke University has high expectations for students’ scholarship and conduct. In accepting admission, students indicate their willingness to subscribe to and be governed by the rules and regulations of the university, which flow from the Duke Community Standard (DCS).\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including but not limited to the academic integrity policy (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects, and more). Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the DCS.\nStudents can direct any questions or concerns regarding academic integrity to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu and can access the DCS guide at https://dukecommunitystandard.students.duke.edu/.\nIn STA 240 specifically…\n\nIf a conduct violation results in a zero on a lab or problem set, that zero will not be dropped;\nIf a conduct violation results in a zero on a midterm, that zero will not be replaced with your final exam score;\nIf we discover that students are sharing and copying assignment solutions, all students involved will be penalized equally, the sharers the same as the recipients.",
