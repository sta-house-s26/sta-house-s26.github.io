    "text": "Use of outside resources, including AI\nThere are at least two reasons you might seek outside resources:\n\n*Extra practice or alternative instruction**: Go crazy. Knock yourself out. Have a ball. The internet is saturated with good (and horrible) resources for learning this material, so if you find something that really resonates with you, have at it;\n*Doing the work for you**: If you ask a language model to generate a summary, and you copy it down and submit it as your own work, that is plagiarism. If we detect it, you will earn a zero for that part of your write-up.\n\n“Using ChatGPT to complete assignments is like bringing a forklift into the weight room; you will never improve your cognitive fitness that way.” Furthermore, this course is a half-credit, pass-fail course purely for your own interest. As such, outsourcing all of your thinking to an AI will probably end in this entire enterprise being a complete waste of time and energy. To avoid this, I suggest you abstain from using language models to do the reading/thinking for you.",

    "text": "Midterm Paper (25%)\nBy that point in the semester, we’ve reviewed many fundamental concepts and models in statistics. Although we still have more to cover, it’s important to reflect on and analyze some statistics on your own, and a write-up will help us accomplish this.\nThe prompt: Please describe the basic mechanics of a statistical method we have encountered so far, including a simple explanation of the method, various indicators for the method, and when it should be used. Then, examine the use of the method in a published research paper that we have not seen in class. This should entail an overview of the article (just enough for us to get our head around the idea and variables), why the method was used, and how it supports the article’s conclusion.\nRequirements: - 650 word minimum. - MLA formatted citations. - Due beginning of class Week 8.",

However, the most important part is being able to apply those skills to a new area and show their similarities and differences in different contexts.\nFor this final project, please write a 1000-word (max) paper and create a 5-10 minute presentation with the following:\n\nPlease describe the basic mechanics of a statistical method/model we have encountered so far, including a simple mathematical explanation of the method, various indicators for the method, and when it should be used. The method chosen must be different from the method used in the midterm paper.\nThen, examine the use of the method/model in a published research paper that we have not seen in class. This should entail a quick overview of the article’s idea and variables, why the method was used, and how it supports the article’s conclusion.\nApply this statistical method/model to a new dataset of your own choosing that we have not seen in class, or replicate some statistical methods being used if the dataset in the article chosen is publicly available. Analyze the data and the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrace\n\n\n\nThere will be two weeks dedicated for presentations. A signup will be sent out after the midterm assignment is due.",
